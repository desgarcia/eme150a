Course Description
==================

| University of California, Davis
| Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering
| Mechanical Design - EME 150A
| Fall 2016, Lecture: MWF 9-9:50AM, Discussion: F 10-10:50AM
| CRN: 31967
| `Catalog Entry <http://catalog.ucdavis.edu/programs/EME/EMEcourses.html>`_

This course introduces the student to mechanical design theory and methodology
that build on the fundamentals learned in statics, dynamics, strength of
materials, computer aided drafting, and manufacturing. The course will prepare
the student to both individually and collaboratively design mechanical systems
that will be safe from failure and ensure that other design constraints are
met.

Objectives
----------

1. Students will demonstrate the use of analytical skills and intuitive
   judgment for mechanical design and the evaluation of structural integrity.
2. Students will develop and use simple analytic models to predict static and
   dynamic stresses and strains in mechanical structures.
3. Students will identify and use appropriate resources in engineering design
   and failure analysis.
4. Students will solve open-ended design problems that require conceptual and
   analytical problem solving and create documentation of design solutions.
5. Students will demonstrate effective engineering writing.

Prerequisites
-------------

- ENG 35 Statics
- ENG 45/45Y Properties of Materials
- ENG 104 Mechanics of Materials
- EME 50 Manufacturing Processes (may be taken concurrently)

ABET Educational Student Outcomes
---------------------------------

This course addresses the following Educational Outcomes for the Mechanical

   d. an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams
   e. an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems
   f. an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility
   g. an ability to communicate effectively

      solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context
   i. a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long
      learning
   k. an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools
      necessary for engineering practice.

Time and Location
=================

The lecture/discussion meets on Mondays and Wednesdays from 9:00-9:50 AM in
Hutchison Hall 102 and Fridays 9:00-10:50 AM in Bainer 2071 (MAE Design
Studio).

**If you have any conflicts with the schedule, especially for the midterm or
exam, you must tell me in the first week of class (emergencies will be the only
exception).**

Office Hours
============

Jason will hold office hours on Thursdays 10-11AM and Fridays from 2-3PM in
Bainer 2095. If you have a time conflict and need to meet outside of these
times, please find an available time on Jason's schedule_ and email him with
the request.

Destiny will hold office hours on Wednesdays from 1-2PM and Fridays from 12-1PM
in a Bainer 2103.

Academic Integrity
==================

Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Please visit the `Academic Integrity
web page <http://sja.ucdavis.edu/academic-integrity.html>`_ from UC Davis
Office of Student Judicial Affairs to review the campus' policy on academic
responsibility and integrity and read the UC Davis `code of academic conduct
<http://sja.ucdavis.edu/cac.html>`_.

The midterm and final exam will be closed note, closed book and done on an
individual basis.

Feel free to discuss homework assignments and work on them together, but each
student must turn in a *unique* solution. Keep in mind that actually doing all
of the homework yourself is critical for learning and passing the course.

The first part of the project will be an mostly individual but have elements of
collaboration built in. The second part of the project will be a group effort
but also include individual evaluation based on peer evaluations.

Textbook
========

*Shigley's Mechanical Engineering Design*, Budynas and Nisbett, 10th Edition,
McGraw Hill Education. ISBN 978-0-07-339820-4 [`Book Information`_]

.. _Book Information: http://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073398209/information_center_view0/index.html

Reading will be assigned from the textbook. I will do my best to provide the
homework in a way that doesn't require you to purchase the book to read any
problems but this is not guaranteed. Older editions will be more than
sufficient for reading and studying. Keep in mind that this particular textbook
is one of the better references to have for your career if you work in
mechanical design.

Assignments & Grades
====================

Grades will be available in the canvas.ucdavis.edu_ grade book periodically
throughout the course along with class statistics. Check the website on a
regular basis to gauge your performance. Keep in mind that **15% is deducted
per business day late** on all assignments.

=====================  ===
Homework               10%
In class               10%
Design Project Part 1  20%
Design Project Part 2  20%
Midterm                20%
Final                  20%
=====================  ===

Homework
   Weekly homework will be assigned which will be due before class the
   following week in the mechanical engineering homework **drop box** in Bainer
   Hall.
In class
   There will be a variety of in class assignments and quizzes that may count
   towards your grade.
`Design Project`_
   There will be a two part design project, one for the first half of the
   course and one for the second. Grades will be determined based on individual
   performance, group performance, and peer evaluations. To pass the course,
   each student must complete the two projects. The part 2 grade will be
   modified based on peer evaluations.

Canvas
======

We will make use of Canvas for the course. Log in to canvas.ucdavis.edu_ with
your Kerberos ID and passphrase then select **EME 150A 001 FQ 2016**.

We will be using several features in canvas:

Announcements
   This will be my primary communication avenue to you. These announcements
   will be forwarded automatically to your UCD email address. You are expected
   to read these either through your email program or on the Canvas website.
Assignments
   The electronic assignments will be distributed and collected here.
Grades
   Your grades and basic stats on your relative performance will be available
   as the course goes along.
Files
   Copyrighted and private files, documents, and other resources will be
   available here for download. The rest will be available for download on this
   website.

Communications
==============

Email
-----

Electronic correspondence from the instructors will be made to your UCD email
address. It is your responsibility to check this regularly.

Electronic announcements from the instructors to the whole class will be made
through Canvas. By default, Canvas will automatically send the announcement to
your UCD email address. You can change your Canvas settings to opt out, send it
them to a different email, or as an SMS. You are responsible for reading the
announcements made via canvas.

When contacting the instructors via email you should default to submitting it
via Piazza (see next section) unless the question is a private matter.

Piazza
------

Piazza should be used for all questions about the class, homework, theory,
projects, etc that is not of a private nature. Piazza allows both the
instructors and students to collectively answer questions for the whole classes
benefit. The instructors can also endorse the student answer if it is correct.
The top student askers and answerers, to be judged by the instructors,
will be rewarded with bonus points to their final grade. The link to the Piazza
site is here:
